## yocto-CI manifest

Yocto-CI manifest is a build-up of the mandatory git repositories, listed below, enabling running `testimage` tests agains QEMU or SIMICS. The manifest comprises the following repositories:
- meta-cxl 
- meta-openembedded
- poky

## Set up access to private repos

First, all/almost all of the repos I keep our Yocto are `private`, aka nobody without explicitly graneded access can access, neither see it. To be able to access it auto from within your account, namely without giving user/password each time when logging you have to cache your credentials. One method I explored successfully is to generate a personal access token (classic) and cache it via `github CLI gh`

- go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and click on `generate a new token`, right hand side

</p>

- then in the imput label `Note` write `yocto-ci`, set expiration to `no expiration` and click on `repo` giving the full control over the private repos, as shown in the figure as fallows

</p>

- then scroll down and click on `generate token`
- make sure to copy the token now as you won’t be able to see it again!

</p>

Once you have the token copied run `gh auth login` pasting it in the last raw
```
$ gh auth login                                            
? Where do you use GitHub? GitHub.com                                                 
? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations on this host? HTTPS              
? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Paste an authentication token        
Tip: you can generate a Personal Access Token here https://github.com/settings/tokens 
The minimum required scopes are 'repo', 'read:org', 'workflow'.                       
? Paste your authentication token:                                                    
```

Now your credentials are cached and no need to provide them each time when accessing the repos.

## hhhh

Clone all the required repos using the `git-repo` tools reading the git menifest file.

```
git clone https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo
./git-repo/repo init -u https://github.com/MarekBykowski/yocto-ci-manifest.git
./git-repo/repo sync
```
