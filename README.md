## Set up access to private repos

First, all/almost all of the repos I keep our Yocto are `private`, aka nobody without explicitly graneded access can access, neither see it. To be able to access it auto from within your account, namely without giving user/password each time when logging you have to cache your credentials. One method I explored successfully is to generate a personal access token (classic) and cache it via `github CLI gh`

- go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and click on `generate new token` (right hand side)

</p>

- then in the imput label `Note` write `yocto-ci`, set expiration to `no expiration` and click on `repo` giving the full control over the private repos, as shown in the figure as fallows

</p>

- then scroll down and click on `generate token`
- make sure to copy the token now as you wonâ€™t be able to see it again!

</p>

Once you have the token copied run `gh auth login` pasting it in the last raw
```
$ gh auth login                                            
? Where do you use GitHub? GitHub.com                                                 
? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations on this host? HTTPS              
? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Paste an authentication token        
Tip: you can generate a Personal Access Token here https://github.com/settings/tokens 
The minimum required scopes are 'repo', 'read:org', 'workflow'.                       
? Paste your authentication token:                                                    
```

Congrats! Now your credentials are cached.

## Clone all the repos required

**This is important!** I have prepared a special path `/yocto/yocto-team` on `GNR` using the `LVM` (logical-volume-manager) concatenating the free spaces across various drives in which all us as should create his/her user dir and work from there.
If not abide by to it we will exhaust the space on GNR shortly. Never ever try these steps in your home dir.

```
mkdir -p /yocto/yocto-team/<user>
cd /yocto/yocto-team/<user>
```

Then clone all the repos required using the `git-repo` tool and the manifest file from within this repo.

```
git clone https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo
./git-repo/repo init -u https://github.com/MarekBykowski/yocto-ci-manifest.git
./git-repo/repo sync
```
