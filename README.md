## Set up access to private repos

First, all/almost all of the repos I keep our Yocto are `private`, aka nobody without explicitly graneded access can access, neither see it. To be able to access it auto from within your account, namely without giving user/password each time when logging you have to cache your credentials. One method I explored successfully is to generate a personal access token (classic) and cache it via `github CLI gh`

- go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and click on `generate a personal access token (classic)`, figure below

- then in `Note` write `yocto-ci`, set expiration to `no expiration` and click on `repo` giving the full control over the private repos, as shown in the figure as fallows

- then scroll down and click on `generate token`
- make sure to copy the token now as you wonâ€™t be able to see it again!
